# Tech-Blog
A CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well.


## Description 
In this challenge I created the home page which shows the previous blog post, a user login/logout, and a user dashboard.

This project (as of Sunday, Nov. 27, 2022) is not done but I am turning in what I have and plan to come back in the future once the course is over in 2+ weeks and complete it. I have learned a lot from this challenge and am excited for more time on it in the future.

Future for this project

-Finish the update/delete of a post.  It currently only can be deleted.

-Add the ability for the user to comment on other users post.

-Style the page. Again, this is just due to time restraints and I am eager to get back to this project in the near future.
